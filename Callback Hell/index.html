    <h1>Callback Hell</h1>
    <p><i>When your JavaScript becomes disgustingly nested with Callbacks to set unknown delays between functions so
            they will run in sequence.
            <br>
            Also introduces the idea of using promises in place of callbacks to ultimately reduce the need for
            nesting.</i></p>
